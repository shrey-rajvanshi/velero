#### 2019-04-24

### Download

### Container Image
`gcr.io/heptio-images/velero:v1.0.0-alpha.2`

### Highlights
Our second v1.0 alpha is ready for testing! Please try it out in your non-critial environments. This alpha contains a bunch of bug fixes and smaller enhancements. See the **All Changes** section below for details.

We expect that our next release will be `v1.0.0-beta.1`, meaning that all key features for v1.0.0 will be included. Following that release, we'll continue to fix
bugs and make minor improvements, and we expect to ship at least one more beta and/or release candidate prior to the general availability of v1.0.0.

### All Changes
* restic repo ensurer: return error if new repository does not become ready within a minute, and fix channel closing/deletion (#1367, @skriss)
* remove deprecated "hooks" for backups (they've been replaced by "pre hooks") (#1384, @skriss)
* fix setting up restic identifiers when fully-qualified plugin names are used (#1377, @jmontleon)
* add `--namespace` flag to `velero install` (@1380, @nrb)
* GCP: allow `storageLocation` to be specified as a config parameter for VolumeSnapshotLocations (#1375, @ctrox)
* add new prometheus gauge metrics `backup_total` and `restore_total` (#1353, @fabito)
* update install docs to use `velero install` (#1376 #1393 #1394, @nrb and @skriss)
* fix panic in API discovery when 1+ API groups cannot be reached (#1399, @skriss)
* fail backup if it already exists in object storage (#1390, @carlisia and @ncdc)

## v1.0.0-alpha.1
#### 2019-04-15

### Download
- https://github.com/heptio/velero/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.1

### Highlights
We're excited to release our first alpha for v1.0! Please take it for a spin in your non-critical environments. Although we've finished the majority of the planned development work for v1.0, we are still working on a handful of items, so don't consider this alpha release to be fully feature-complete. Here's a quick rundown of the major changes in this release:

- We've added a new command, `velero install`, to make it easier to get up and running with Velero
- We've made a bunch of improvements to the plugin framework:
    - we've reorganized the relevant packages to minimize the import surface for plugin authors
    - all plugins are now wrapped in panic handlers that will report information on panics back to Velero
    - Velero's `--log-level` flag is now passed to plugin implementations
    - Errors logged within plugins are now annotated with the file/line of where the error occurred
    - Restore item actions can now optionally return a list of additional related items that should be restored
    - Restore item actions can now indicate that an item *should not* be restored
- The restic restore helper image used by Velero can now optionally be overridden via config map

### Breaking & Notable Changes

#### API
* All legacy Ark data types and pre-1.0 compatibility code has been removed. Users should migrate any backups created pre-v0.11.0 with the v0.11.1 migration command (not yet released)

#### Azure
* During installation, the `cloud-credentials` secret can now be created from a file, whose contents look like the following:
    ```
    AZURE_TENANT_ID=${AZURE_TENANT_ID}
    AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=${AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}
    AZURE_CLIENT_ID=${AZURE_CLIENT_ID}
    AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=${AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET}
    AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP=${AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP}
    ```
  When using this method, the `cloud-credentials` secret should be mounted as a volume into the Velero deployment and daemon set, at the path `/credentials`. Additionally, the `$AZURE_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable should be set to `/credentials/cloud` (the location of the file within the Velero pods). Note that `velero install` always uses this method of providing credentials for Azure.

#### Image
* The base container image has been switched to `debian:stretch-slim`

#### Plugin Development
* `BlockStore` plugins are now named `VolumeSnapshotter` plugins
* Plugin APIs have moved to reduce the import surface:
    * Plugin gRPC servers live in `github.com/heptio/velero/pkg/plugin/framework`
    * Plugin interface types live in `github.com/heptio/velero/pkg/plugin/velero`
* RestoreItemAction interface now takes the original item from the backup as a parameter
* RestoreItemAction plugins can now return additional items to restore
* RestoreItemAction plugins can now skip restoring an item
* Plugins may now send stack traces with errors to the Velero server, so that the errors may be put into the server log
* Plugins must now be "namespaced," using `example.domain.com/plugin-name` format
    * For external ObjectStore and VolumeSnapshotter plugins. this name will also be the provider name in BackupStorageLoction and VolumeSnapshotLocation objects
* `--log-level` flag is now passed to all plugins

#### Validation
* Configs for Azure, AWS, and GCP are now checked for invalid or extra keys, and the server is halted if any are found

### Coming in Future Alpha/Beta Releases:
- backup & restore phases will be modified to more clearly indicate successes, failures, and partial failures
- additional safety checks to ensure backups are never overwritten in object storage
- revised installation documentation that takes advantage of the `velero install` command
- as many additional stability and UX issues as we can get to
